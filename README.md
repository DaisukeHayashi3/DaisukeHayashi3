# Dashboard for Code History & Handover

This dashboard is designed to document the code history of imaging system projects and facilitate the handover process to future students. It includes information on the following projects:

- **DOT (Diffuse Optical Tomography)** for multi-tap image sensors
- **ADMM-Net**,Reproduction for Compressive Sensing using charge-domain time-compressive ToF sensors

### Features

- Track the development history of various imaging system projects.
- Provide an easy-to-understand handover for new students joining the lab.

### Technology Stack

- **Language:** Python
- **Editor:** JupyterLab
- **Dependencies:** All required dependencies are listed in `requirements.txt`. To install them, run:
  ```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
  ```

### Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory and install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. Usage instructions are provided in the corresponding Python file.

### Usage

The dashboard allows students to track code history, view project details, and update records. Usage instructions are written in a Python file within the repository.

### DNN for Finance

I created this as an exercise for creating a deep learning framework when I was interested in the stock market.
I obtained stock price data from a site called stooq and trained the model in a simple LSTM cell.
